        and I am a professional front end Web developer. My passion for Design
        and software development intrigued me to take higher education within
        the field of front end development. Since I have been designing websites
        and user experiences for the past couple of years I have gained broad
        experience when it comes to building the right type of website for your
        specific target audience.

        I have been working in the software industry for quite a while now. In
        my previous job before I started Venora Web Development I worked as a
        test manager at Capgemini. I was not involved in coding but rather
        testing the developed solutions to quality assure the delivery before
        handing it over to the clients. With that experience and competence in
        my stack I am able to be hired for QA work as well as web development.
        If you have a project which you think I can contribute to, feel free to
        send me an inquiry or give me a call. You can find my contact info

        I am capable of developing in html, css and javascript. I am also
        familiar with a couple of frameworks like Sass, Stylus, Less and React
        which allows me to build Interactive web solutions. In addition to this
        I am proficient in photoshop, prototype tools like Adobe XD and UXpin
        and Adobe Illustrator. This enables me to deliver services of
        prototyping, design and photo editing as well.
